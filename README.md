# PembinaGorgeTrail
Interactive map that outlines the ATV trails at the Pembina Gorge State Recreation Area near Walhalla, ND.
The coordinates were recorded with a GPS unit and converted into a polyline in sections of trail, which are
then linked to a specific timestamp in a Youtube video that displays that portion of trail.
